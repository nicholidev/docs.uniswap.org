## `SafeCast`

Safe down casting methods


Contains methods for safely downcasting to smaller types




### `toUint160(uint256 y) → uint160 z` (internal)

Cast a uint256 to a uint160, revert on overflow





z: The downcasted integer, now type uint160

### `toInt128(int256 y) → int128 z` (internal)

Cast a int256 to a int128, revert on overflow or underflow





z: The downcasted integer, now type int128

### `toInt256(uint256 y) → int256 z` (internal)

Cast a uint256 to a int256, revert on overflow





z: The downcasted integer, now type int256
