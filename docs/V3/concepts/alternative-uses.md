## Single Asset Issuance Sales

if you set the min price to spot, you can put in only one token and offer an ascending curve of price relative to the other, in a socks style 


One interesting alternative use of the V3 pair contract is as a mechanism for single asset issuance sales. 

Lets say you have a token that is redeemable for a mug, you can mint 100 MUGS and create a pair 



If you have an asset that you would like to release to market, you can create a pair, for example MUGS paired eith ETH - but allocate liquidity only in MUGS
