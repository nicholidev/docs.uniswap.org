## Introduction

The defining idea of Uniswap v3 is concentrated liquidity: liquidity that is allocated within a custom price boundary.

In earlier versions, liquidity was distributed uniformly along the ùë• ¬∑ ùë¶ = L<sup>2</sup> reserves curve, where ùë• and ùë¶ are the respective reserves of two assets X and Y, and L[^1] is a constant measure of liquidity. 

The previously uniform distribution allowed trading across the entire price interval (0, ‚àû) without any loss of liquidity. However, in many pools, the majority of the liquidity was never used. 

Consider stablecoin pairs, where the price of the asset stays relatively constant. The liquidity outside the typical price range of a stablecoin pair is rarely touched. For example, the v2 DAI/USDC pair utilizes ~0.50% of the total available capital for trading between $0.99 and $1.01, the price range in which LPs would expect to see the most volume - and consequently earn the most fees.

With v3, liquidity providers may concentrate their capital to smaller price intervals than (0, ‚àû). We call liquidity concentrated to a finite interval a position. LPs may have many different positions, creating individualized price curves that reflect the preferences of each LP.

## Active Liquidity

As the price of an asset rises or falls, it may exit the price bounds that LPs have set in a position. When the price exits a position's interval, the position's liquidity is no longer active and no longer earns fees. At this point, the LPs provided liquidity is composed entirely of a single asset, as the reserves of the other asset have been entirely depleted through swapping. 

As price moves in one direction, LPs gain more of the one asset as swappers demand the other, until their entire liquidity consists of only one asset. (In v2, we don't typically see this behavior because LPs rarely reach the upper or lower bound of the price of two assets, i.e., 0 and ‚àû). If the price ever reenters the interval, the liquidity becomes active again, and in-range LPs begin earning fees once more.

Importantly, LPs are free to create as many positions as they see fit, each with its own price interval. Concentrated liquidity serves as a mechanism to let the market decide what a sensible distribution of liquidity is, as rational LPs are incentivized to concentrate their liquidity while ensuring that their liquidity remains active.

## Ticks

To achieve concentrated liquidity, the once continuous spectrum of price space has been partitioned with ticks.

Ticks are the boundaries between discrete areas in price space. Ticks are spaced such that an increase of 1 tick represents a .01% increase in price at any point along the curve.

Ticks function as boundaries for liquidity positions. When a position is created, the provider must choose the beginning and ending tick that will represent their position's borders.

As the spot price changes during swapping, the pool contract will continuously exchange the outbound asset for the inbound, progressively utilizing all the liquidity available within the current tick interval[^2] until the next tick is reached. At this point, the contract switches to a new tick and activates any dormant liquidity within a position that has a boundary at the newly active tick.
