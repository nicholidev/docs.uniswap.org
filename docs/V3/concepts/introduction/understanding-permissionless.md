title: Understanding Permissionless
---

The word permissionless gets thrown around a lot in DeFi, with varying degrees of clarity. Despite its frequent use, permissionless systems are relatively new to the public sphere. While typically received as a positive attribute, there are both advantages and disadvantages to these systems that are important to understand when interacting with them.  

*I've heard Uniswap described as "permissionless," but what does that mean?*

Describing a system as permissionless means that there are fundamental mechanisms within it that are entirely open for public use, with no selective restriction on who can, or cannot, use them.

*That sounds pretty unremarkable; the internet is open to everyone, isn't it?*

While the internet may initially appear open to anyone, there are labyrinths of permission layers which one is filtered through any time one is using it. Nearly all banks, payment processors, ticketing systems, or any other business involving value transfer have many obvious, as well as hidden, restrictions.

A permissionless system on the internet, as we have known it, is actually quite rare. This makes intuitively understanding them difficult as there are so few contextual examples from which to draw our understanding.

*This is all very abstract, do you have a concrete example?*

In many online systems involving value transfer, one may need to login, provide identifying information, and be discreetly approved once the given system decides the user is "playing by the rules". In the event of an accident or misbehavior, this box-checking system usually establishes a route backward to rectify the situation, typically by undoing the mistake or identifying the misbehaver.

In areas where blockchain-based software is permissionless, no such routes exist. Publicly available permissionless features enable anyone to create permanent change that cannot be undone, even by the software's creator.

*This sounds risky; why would anyone want to give up the safety net of permissioned systems?*

Permissionless systems create risk where others do not. Users need to take more care and do more research before interacting with these systems.

The strength of permissionless systems, though, goes hand in hand with the risk. Through their inalterable public utility, permissionless features allow a system the potential to grow into a robust, censorship-resistant ecosystem, that can eventually outstrip permission-based systems in efficacy and productivity to a degree that, many would say, justifies their increased user risk.

*Ok, What part of Uniswap is permissionless?*

The clearest example of this within the Uniswap Protocol is the creation of a trading pair. In a typical trading system, exposing an asset to a market involves a sizable amount of box-checking: fee collection, information gathering, and general networking are associated with the traditional process, all in the name of ensuring the trustworthiness of the asset creator, with the added “benefit” of securing the power of the gatekeeper. The Uniswap Protocol forces no such process. Anyone, anywhere in the world, may create a trading pair at any time. 

The negative result is easy to anticipate: there are many useless tokens available for swapping on the Uniswap protocol, and many tokens claiming to do something they do not. Along with the nonsense, however, comes the diamond in the rough. Permission-less pair creation allows anyone to exposure their digital asset to a global market, completely removing the traditional gatekeeper mold. Having low funding, no connections, or in some other way not fitting consensus opinions are no longer barriers to market as they were in the past.

The positive result is that real innovation is never stifled. If some group or individual creates a new system that is valuable and helpful, it will have its fair chance where it may have otherwise been silenced.


Addendum: We developed the Token List system to help ease the burden of research and verification which falls on users.
