Welcome to the Uniswap v3 docs!

More docs will appear here in the coming weeks, including overview and advanced concepts, guides, and explorations of design decisions.

For the time being, these pages contain information on the [Uniswap v3 Core smart contracts](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core). Many of the detailed contracts and functions are quite low-level, and require a fair amount of context to understand. However, these docs and the code are the best place to start digging into the details. For examples of how to safely interact with the core contracts, see [Uniswap v3 Periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-periphery).
