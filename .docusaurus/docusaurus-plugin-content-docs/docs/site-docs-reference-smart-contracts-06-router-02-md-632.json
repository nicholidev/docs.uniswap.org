  "description": "Because routers are stateless and do not hold token balances, they can be replaced safely and trustlessly, if necessary. This may happen if more efficient smart contract patterns are discovered, or if additional functionality is desired. For this reason, routers have release numbers, starting at 01. This is currently recommended release, 02.",
