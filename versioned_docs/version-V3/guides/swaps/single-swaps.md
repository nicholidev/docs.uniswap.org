## Setting up the Contract

First we declare the solidity version that will be used to compile the contract, and the `abicoder v2` to allow arbitrary nested arrays and structs 
to be encoded and decoded in calldata, a feature we use when executing a swap.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later
pragma solidity =0.7.6;
pragma abicoder v2;
```

Next, import the two contracts we'll be using from the npm package installation

```solidity
import '@uniswap/v3-periphery/contracts/interfaces/ISwapRouter.sol';
import '@uniswap/v3-periphery/contracts/libraries/TransferHelper.sol';
```

Here we create our contract called `SwapExamples`, and declare an immutable public variable `swapRouter` of type `ISwapRouter`. 
This allows us to call functions in the `ISwapRouter` interface.


```solidity
contract SwapExamples {
    // For the scope of these swap examples,
    // we will detail the design considerations when using `exactInput`, `exactInputSingle`, `exactOutput`, and  `exactOutputSingle`.
    // It should be noted that for the sake of these examples, we pass in the swap router as a constructor argument, instead of inheriting it.
    // More advanced example contracts will detail how to inherit the swap router safely.
    // This example swaps DAI/WETH9 for single path swaps and DAI/USDC/WETH9 for multi path swaps.

    ISwapRouter public immutable swapRouter;

```

Here we hardcode the token contract addresses and pool fee tiers for our example. In production, you would likely use a memory variable for this, so you could change what the pools and tokens you are interacting with on a per transaction basis, but for conceptual simplicity we are hardcoding them here.

```solidity
    address public constant DAI = 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F;
    address public constant WETH9 = 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2;
    address public constant USDC = 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48;

    // For this example, we will set the pool fee to 0.3%.
    uint24 public constant poolFee = 3000;

    constructor(ISwapRouter _swapRouter) {
        swapRouter = _swapRouter;
    }
```

## Exact Input Swaps

```solidity
    /// @notice swapExactInputSingle swaps a fixed amount of DAI for a maximum possible amount of WETH9
    /// using the DAI/WETH9 0.3% pool by calling `exactInputSingle` in the swap router.
    /// @dev The calling address must approve this contract to spend at least `amountIn` worth of its DAI for this function to succeed.
    /// @param amountIn The exact amount of DAI that will be swapped for WETH9.
    /// @return amountOut The amount of WETH9 received.
    function swapExactInputSingle(uint256 amountIn) external returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        // msg.sender must approve this contract

        // Transfer the specified amount of DAI to this contract.
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(DAI, msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);

        // Approve the router to spend DAI.
        TransferHelper.safeApprove(DAI, address(swapRouter), amountIn);

        // Naively set amountOutMinimum to 0. In production, use an oracle or other data source to choose a safer value for amountOutMinimum.
        // We also set the sqrtPriceLimitx96 to be 0 to ensure we swap our exact input amount.
        ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params =
            ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams({
                tokenIn: DAI,
                tokenOut: WETH9,
                fee: poolFee,
                recipient: msg.sender,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: amountIn,
                amountOutMinimum: 0,
                sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
            });

        // The call to `exactInputSingle` executes the swap.
        amountOut = swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params);
    }
```

## Exact Output swaps

```solidity
    /// @notice swapExactOutputSingle swaps a minimum possible amount of DAI for a fixed amount of WETH.
    /// @dev The calling address must approve this contract to spend its DAI for this function to succeed. As the amount of input DAI is variable,
    /// the calling address will need to approve for a slightly higher amount, anticipating some variance.
    /// @param amountOut The exact amount of WETH9 to receive from the swap.
    /// @param amountInMaximum The amount of DAI we are willing to spend to receive the specified amount of WETH9.
    /// @return amountIn The amount of DAI actually spent in the swap.
    function swapExactOutputSingle(uint256 amountOut, uint256 amountInMaximum) external returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        // Transfer the specified amount of DAI to this contract.
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(DAI, msg.sender, address(this), amountInMaximum);

        // Approve the router to spend the specified `amountInMaximum` of DAI.
        // In production, you should choose the maximum amount to spend based on oracles or other data sources to achieve a better swap.
        TransferHelper.safeApprove(DAI, address(swapRouter), amountInMaximum);

        ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams memory params =
            ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams({
                tokenIn: DAI,
                tokenOut: WETH9,
                fee: poolFee,
                recipient: msg.sender,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountOut: amountOut,
                amountInMaximum: amountInMaximum,
                sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
            });

        // Executes the swap returning the amountIn needed to spend to receive the desired amountOut.
        amountIn = swapRouter.exactOutputSingle(params);

        // For exact output swaps, the amountInMaximum may not have all been spent.
        // If the actual amount spent (amountIn) is less than the specified maximum amount, we must refund the msg.sender and approve the swapRouter to spend 0.
        if (amountIn < amountInMaximum) {
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(DAI, address(swapRouter), 0);
            TransferHelper.safeTransfer(DAI, msg.sender, amountInMaximum - amountIn);
        }
    }
```
